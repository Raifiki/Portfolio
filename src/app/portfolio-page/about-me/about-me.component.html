        <h2>About me</h2>
        <span>Hey, I'm Leo Wei√ü, and after 7 years in power electronics development, I've decided to dive into the world of software. I've always been passionate about coding, which led me to successfully transition to frontend development through the Developer Academy. During this part-time training, I worked on individual and team projects, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Interested? You can find all my abilities and top projects listed below.</span>
